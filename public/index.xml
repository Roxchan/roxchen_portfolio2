      <description>This is a project I did in my master course, where I build a effective database for an Electric Wheels Transport company.
The main reason behind carrying out this project was to help EWT as a start-up business to establish a database and boost business performance.
Using appropriate fact-finding techniques to collect business requirements. Cleaned more than 10k customer raw data and eliminated integrity constraints and default values and created a data dictionary.</description>

      <description>Data analytics and Data visualisation are my passion. I completed my bachelor degree in public management. Since the fresher, I was obsessed with data, and I learned Tableau Builder and MC Excel to clean up row data by myself. This Portfolio shows the recent projects I have worked on.</description>
